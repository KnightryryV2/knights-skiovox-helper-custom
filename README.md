## How to change background (this is the only way this works for me, sorry. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND A BETTER WAY)
> I know its a bit unintuitive, but youll need to edit the extention files for this.
> Your image file NEEDS to be a PNG.
1. First you need to move the image file into the new-tab folder and NAME IT AS background.png
2. Check the background in the new tab page. If the text look easy to see then all is good! if the center text looks hard to see, then move on to step 3. if any of the icons look hard to see, look at step 4.
3. Go into the style.css file and go into ".center" section and change the text color to black! (or white if it is already black)
4. Go into your new tab page, and change the NORMAL way to change the background color until it fixes.


*Note: You can exit fullscreen by pressing ctrl+T after you've set up the shortcuts.*
